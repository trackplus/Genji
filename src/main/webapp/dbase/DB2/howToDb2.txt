1.Instal DB2 and create a new database (for example named  TRACK).
	-	The schema name should be the same as the user name      
	-	You should have enough Table Spaces (default is 4 k, choose 32K) (If the space is not sufficient the scripts will not run)
  
2.Run Scripts: .../dbase/DB2/id-table-schema.sql, .../dbase/DB2/track-schema.sql, .../dbase/populate.sql

	-	Before running the scrips be sure that the curent schema is that created with the same user name. 
	-	The populate.sql must be with the right format for time: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.nnnnn
   		(set the dates in the two INSERT INTO TPERSON statements to the time pattern above, 
		or delete the two date fields (TOKENEXPDATE and EMAILLASTREMINDED) from these insert statemenets at all)

3.The JDBC driver for DB2
	-	Be sure that you have a DB2 JDBC driver (for example db2java.jar) in your track/WEB-INF/lib. 

4.Change Torque.properties to map to db2

torque.dsfactory.track.connection.user = yourDB2Username
torque.dsfactory.track.connection.password = yourDB2Password

#DB2
torque.database.track.adapter=db2app
torque.dsfactory.track.connection.driver =COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver
torque.dsfactory.track.connection.url =jdbc:db2:TRACK
