<h1 class="title topictitle1">RACI roles and the RACI matrix</h1>



<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Roles exist to control access to items in general. Beyond these generic roles there are
        four item-specific roles based on the RACI method.</p>

<p class="p">As a user, you permanently work in the system under the space specific roles that determine what
            permissions and rights you have with regard to items in spaces. Additionally you may
            have a more specific relation to a single item, like you have created it, or you are
            currently responsible for it. These item-specific roles are structured according to the
                „<strong class="ph b">RACI</strong>“ scheme.</p>

    <p class="p">The RACI scheme defines four roles: <span class="q">"<span class="ph">Responsible</span>"</span>, <span class="q">"<span class="ph">Accountable</span>"</span>, <span class="q">"<span class="ph">Consulted</span>"</span>, and
        <span class="q">"<span class="ph">Informed</span>"</span>.</p>

<div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/raciroles.png" height="131" width="385"/></div><br/><p class="figcapcenter">RACI roles</p>
    

</div>

<p class="p">If you are <strong class="ph b"><span class="ph">Responsible</span></strong>
            for an item, you need to take care of it. If you
            delegate an item, you effectively change the <span class="ph">Responsible</span>. It is good practice to have a single person be responsible for an item. Only in
            special cases early in a workflow it might be useful to have a group as <span class="ph">Responsible</span>. As a <span class="ph">Responsible</span> for an item you will always be able to edit
            it, regardless of your general role permissions in a space.</p>

<p class="p">If you are <strong class="ph b"><span class="ph">Accountable</span></strong>
            for an item, you look after
            it that it doesn't get lost or stuck. For example, it could be that somebody left your
            team and she is still responsible for a number of items. You as <span class="ph">Accountable</span> make sure that these items are reassigned to
            somebody else. As <span class="ph">Accountable</span> you account for the time
            and money that has been and could be spent on items. As an <span class="ph">Accountable</span> for an item you will always be able to edit
            it, regardless of your general role permissions in a space.</p>

<p class="p">If you are <strong class="ph b"><span class="ph">Consulted</span></strong>
            for an item your input might be required to generate the
            desired outcome for this item. It is quite common that more than one person would have
            to be consulted for an item. As a consulted of an item, you may deal with it as if you
            were responsible. E. g., you may read it, edit it, add comments, or change its state. As
            a <span class="q">"<span class="ph">Consulted</span>"</span> for an item you will always be able
            to edit it, regardless of your general role permissions in a space.</p>

<p class="p">If you are <strong class="ph b">informed</strong>
for an item you would need information from this
item to make progress on your own items. It is quite common that a number of
team members are in the informed role for an item. As an informed, you will be
able to read all item information, but you cannot alter the item.</p>

<p class="p">You can use the consulted and informed roles to selectively grant people
access to items they otherwise would have no permission for.</p>

<div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/raciMatrix.png" height="201" width="331"/></div><br/>

</div>

<p class="p">The RACI matrix defines for each action or
item who assumes what role. You should not have any row without an „R“ and an
„A“; ideally each row should have exactly one „R“ and one „A“. If there are too
many „R“ in any one column, you might have a bottleneck there. If you have a lot
of „I“ and „C“ in your matrix, you may distribute too much information to people
that do not really need it.</p>

        <div class="p">
            <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> RACI roles are independent of the space related role model. Space
                related roles pertain to a <strong class="ph b">space</strong>. RACI roles are <strong class="ph b">item specific</strong>, you
                carry that role for specific items.</div>
