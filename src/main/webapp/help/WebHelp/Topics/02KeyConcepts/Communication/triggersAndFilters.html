  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Triggers and conditions</h1>

  
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can receive e-mail notifications from the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>
    system when items you have an interest in are created, changed, or due. You can control under
    what circumstances you receive such information by means of automail triggers and automail
    conditions.</p>

    <p class="p">Sending an e-mail upon creation or modification of an item is a two stage process, as shown
      in the figure below.</p>

    <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/notification.png" height="203" width="463" alt="automail triggers and conditions"/></div><br/><p class="figcapcenter">Automail triggers and automail conditions</p>
      
      
    </div>

    <p class="p">First, based on a configurable trigger an e-mail notification is triggered. Next, the item
      causing the trigger event is examined by the automail condition. Only if the item meets the
      condition, an e-mail is actually sent.</p>

    <p class="p">In the example above, only when the state or the responsible person or the end date changes,
      an e-mail is triggered. But only if the new <span class="ph">priority</span> of the item, that is the <span class="ph">priority</span> after
      the item has been changed, is "high" and "Susan Doe" is either the new or
      the old responsible, an e-mail is actually being sent.</p>

    <p class="p">With automail triggers, you can define for each action type (create, edit, change cost and
      budget related information), for each RACI and item role (manager, responsible, author,
      consulted, informed, watchers), and for each item property whether a message is triggered or
      not.</p>

    <div class="p">
      <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Automail triggers cannot be used to exclude others from notification
        e-mails. Any user can overwrite for himself the space or system wide settings. Automail
        triggers define how YOU will be informed, or others that also use the same trigger.</div>

    </div>

    <p class="p">As a standard user you don’t have to define your own trigger settings. In this case the space
      or system defaults will pertain to you. If you want to define your own trigger, start with
      copying an existing one.</p>

    <p class="p">With automail conditions you can define complex filter criteria based on new and previous
      item property values. For example, you only want to be notified if an item was reopened or
      when it was closed. </p>

    <p class="p">You can define your own conditions, or use existing conditions, and you can assign your
      personal condition specifically for each space. If you do not do this, the settings provided
      by the space or system administrator prevail.</p>

    <p class="p">All properties can be selected with either their „new“ or their „old“ value. „New“ means the
      property value that was the result of the action causing the automail trigger, and old means
      the value the property carried before the action.</p>

    <p class="p">This makes it possible to define conditions that check for transitions, for example state
      transitions from anywhere to closed, or responsible transitions from yourself to anybody
      else.</p>
