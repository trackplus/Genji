 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Workflows based on UML state diagrams</h1>

 
 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Simple workflows can be modeled as UML state diagrams for a single item. An item is
  moved from one state to the next by means of actions or triggering events. Each state represents a
  workflow station.</p>

  <p class="p">Items have a state like "new", "processing" or "rejected".
   Statuses could also be named according to a location or position in the workflow, like "team
   leader", "department leader" and "human resources" for a vacation
   application.</p>

  <div class="p">Before an item comes into permanent existence, it is in an "initial state". The
   life-cycle of an item ends with the "final state". Transitions from one state to the
   next are triggered by "events". An event can be an explicit action, like somebody
   changed the item state. It can also be an indirect action, for example a timeout, or an action
   "next step", Timeouts are helpful to escalate items when they haven't been taken care
   of within a given time frame. <div class="fig fignone"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="concept_g42_4n3_5k__image_utq_b3m_5k" src="figures/workflowUML.png" height="470" width="390" alt="Example UML workflow diagram"/></div><br/><p class="figcapcenter">Example UML workflow diagram</p>
    
    
   </div>
</div>

  <p class="p">With each transition you can associate "activities". These activities are carried out
   when the transition is taken. For example, when the vacation application has been approved by the
   team leader, the "next step" trigger event would move the item to a new state
   "department leader" and at the same time would change the responsible person to the
   department leaders secretary. </p>
