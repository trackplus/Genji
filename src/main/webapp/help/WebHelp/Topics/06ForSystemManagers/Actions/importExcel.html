    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Importing items from Excel</h1>

    
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can import items from Excel sheets. If <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>
        detects that items already exist in its database, these items are modified rather than
        created again.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview</h2>
            
            <p class="p">To create items from an
                Excel spread sheet you enter all required data
                into that sheet on your local computer. The first row of the spread sheet contains
                the field or property names, all following rows contain item data, one item per
                row.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/excel1.png" height="168" width="444"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">Then you upload the sheet to the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> server. To
                import items from an Excel sheet go to Administration &gt; Import.</p>

            <p class="p">On the next screen you will be able to select the Excel file from which you want to
                import items into the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> will upload the Excel file to the server
                for further analysis. You can now select the sheet inside the Excel file from which
                you want to import items.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> will try to map all columns in your Excel
                sheet to its own fields. You can control this mapping process manually. <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> will memorize your last mapping
                definitions and reuse them in all subsequent imports, so that after your first
                import all following imports typically require just uploading the file.</p>

            <p class="p">In the next step, you define how <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> should
                handle required values that it cannot find in your Excel spread sheet. There are two
                options: either the row is rejected, or a default value is being inserted by <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="p">If there are problems with the spread sheet, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> will give you exact hints on the row and data it has problems with. You can then
                correct the spread sheet and upload the file again.</p>

            <p class="p">If everything goes well, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> creates one item
                for each row in your spread sheet. You can only import system and custom fields. It
                is not possible to import consulted/informed information, costs, or budgets.</p>

            <p class="p">You don‘t have to enter a project in your spread sheet. You can select a project
                during the import process for all items.</p>

            <p class="p">The order of the columns in your spread sheet is of no importance. You should just
                keep it the same in all subsequent imports to minimize your configuration
                effort.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Column Mapping</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The column headers should be mapped to the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>
                fields. If a column header is not mapped then the values from that column will not
                be imported.</p>

            <p class="p">When you use the import facility the first time, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> tries a best match of the column headers
                to its own fields. This match is based on</p>

            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">localized field configuration (localized field labels)</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">not localized field configuration (original field labels)</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">field names</p>

                </li>

            </ol>

            <p class="p">You can now go ahead and change the mapping manually, in case <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> didn‘t find the right solution for your
                spread sheet. The import wizard shows the field labels as defined in the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> global scope, not the ones specific for
                item type, project type, or project, since a sheet may contain items from more than
                one project and/or item type. </p>

            <p class="p">Thus, you need to know the global field configuration label for each field, even
                though that label can be different in your own project or for your own item types. </p>

            <p class="p">Once the NEXT button is clicked the mapping is saved on the disk in a user specific
                directory and will be used as the default mapping for your next import.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Composite Field Handling</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Composite fields are contained in a single column. The different sections of a
                composite fields have to separated by a “|” character.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Multiple Value Field Handling</h2>
            
            <p class="p">For multiple value fields, all values are contained in the same column. The different
                values must be separated by comma (“,”).</p>

            <p class="p">Each row of data in the spread sheet will be validated on several levels before an

                        the required field in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>, or you have
                        selected that default values should be used in case there are no values in

                                exist it will be checked if it is valid or not. For example, for the

                                manager it is checked that this person actually has manager rights
                                in that project, and so on).</p>

                        your Excel sheet. If that is not possible you can define a combination of
                        identifier columns which should uniquely identify each item. </p>

                    <p class="p">For example, you can set the originator, project, and title combined as a
                        unique identifier. This implies that these three fields are not modified
                        between re-imports, and that their combination is unique. If a matching item
                        is not found, a new item is created. If a matching item is found, the
                        changes from the non-identifying columns will be applied.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conflict Resolution</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When importing data from an Excel sheet, there can be conflicts, for example when <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> recognizes an Excel row as an existing
                item, but there is conflicting data within that item between the Excel version and
                the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> item version.</p>

            <p class="p">If inside the Excel sheet there is no column for the last edit date, there is no
                usable history data available and all fields that have been changed in either <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> or Excel can be in conflict. If in Excel
                there is data for the last edit date, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> can
                perform some intelligent conflict handling because it can take into account the
                temporal order in which changes happened. The handling differs for fields that have
                an explicit history enabled in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>, and those
                that don’t. You can select explicit history for all fields, but that is not the
                default.</p>

            <p class="p">In case a fields history recording is enabled in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>, the conflict resolution handling is as
                follows:</p>

            <p class="p">It will be verified whether the first old value form the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> history (after last edit date) is the same
                as the actual value from Excel. If it is the same, then the change was made only in
                    <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> and not in Excel. Consequently the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> value will be silently preserved, and the
                user will not be asked for conflict resolution. Otherwise the user will be involved
                in the conflict handling process.</p>

            <p class="p">In case a field has no explicit history recording, field changes are only recorded in
                the common history. For such fields, there is no reliable way to find out whether
                such a field was modified only in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> or also
                in Excel. Therefore when at least one common history entry exists after the last
                edit date in Excel, then each changed field without explicit history is subject to
                conflict handling.</p>

            <p class="p">If there is no history data since last edit, then the change in the Excel file will
                overwrite the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> value without conflict
                resolution.</p>
