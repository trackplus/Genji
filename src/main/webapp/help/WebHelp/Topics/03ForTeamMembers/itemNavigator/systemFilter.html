<h1 class="title topictitle1">System filter and your filters</h1>



<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">To display a specific collection of items, you either apply predefined views, you click
on links in cockpit views, or you use the full text search box. <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> will make sure you will only
see items that you have been authorized to see, regardless of the filter settings.</p>
<p class="p">You can envision the procedure to get a set of items from the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> database as two stage
filtering process. At the filter input there are all items in the database, which can amount to
several hundred thousand. When you apply a filter, these items have to first pass the system
filter. </p>

<p class="p">The system filter makes sure you will only be able to see items
you are authorized to see. For example, you will never be able to
see items that have been marked private by another person, or that
belong to a project where you have no read permission.</p>

<p class="p">In the second stage, the remaining items have to pass your view
filter. Here you can define all kinds of criteria to restrict the
result to those items you are interested in at that moment.</p>

<div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/filterPrinciple.png" height="319" width="310"/></div><br/>

</div>

<p class="p">You cannot manipulate the system filter in any other way than
obtaining access rights via roles in projects. You can however create
as many personal view filters as you like and save them for later
use. Some cockpit views provide filters, and there are some predefined
views with filters you can use. It is likely that you will create
five to ten personal views that you will be using all the time.
If you are a project manager, you can provide views to your team
members, so that all of you have the same view.</p>
