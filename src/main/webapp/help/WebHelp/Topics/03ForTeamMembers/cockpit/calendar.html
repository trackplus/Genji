        <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can place a calendar onto your
            cockpit which will show you your items in case they have start or
            due dates. Their is no need to configure the calendar
            tile.</p>

            <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Configuration</h2>
                
                <p class="p">Before you can use this tile you need to configure it. Follow
                    the general procedure to configure a tile outlined above to
                    get to the calendar configuration page, as described
                    above.</p>

                <p class="p">You can change the description
                    of the tile to give it a more precise meaning. This is
                    particular helpful if you use more than one instance of this
                    tile in your project, for example one grouped by state, and
                    one by responsible.</p>

                <p class="p">You can select which projects and/or releases you want to
                    consider in this tile, or use any filter you have defined
                    previously. Selecting a project will include all releases of
                    that project. </p>

                <p class="p">Last you need to select the grouping criterion. You can group
                    by: </p>

                <p class="p">Save your configuration by clicking on the „Save“ button. You
                    will be returned to the tile configuration. Click on the
                    „back“ button in the toolbar area, to finalize the
                    configuration.</p>

            <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Weekly View</h2>
                
                <p class="p">The
                    weekly
                    view comprises a header row and the fields for the different
                    days of the week. The header row displays the current
                    calendar week. There are two arrow buttons on the left and
                    on the right with which you can move a week backwards or
                    forward. The current day is marked by a red frame.</p>

                    the month where the currently selected date is in. In case
                    you have not selected any day, the current month will be
                    displayed.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Monthly View</h2>
                
                <p class="p">The header of the
                    monthly
                    view comprises of two rows. The first row contains the name
                    of the month, two arrow buttons with which you can move one

                    and the coming year. Clicking on the respective year will
                    move you one year forward or backward.</p>

                <p class="p">The second row contains the day of the week. Each calendar
                    field contains the day and month in an abbreviated form.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/calendarMonthly.png" height="259" width="517"/></div><br/>
                    
                </div>

                <p class="p">At the top of the calendar there are two buttons: „Today“ and
                    „Weekly View“. With the „Today“ button you switch to the
                    current month and the current day. The current day will be
                    selected, shown by the yellowish background. The current day
                    is furthermore marked by a red frame</p>

                <p class="p">When you click onto the „Weekly View“ button, the week that
                    contains the currently selected day will be shown. If there
                    was no day selected, the current week will be shown.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Selecting Dates</h2>
                
                <p class="p">You can mark a date as
                    selected
                    by clicking into it. The selected date is marked with a
                    yellowish background. When you browse forward or backward
                    the date remains selected as long as you do not select a
                    different date.</p>

                <p class="p">When you change from monthly to weekly view, the week with
                    the selected date will be shown.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Active Links</h2>
                
                <p class="p">When there is one of your
                    items, e.g.
                    an item where you are either the original author of, or the
                    current responsible, or the manager, and this item has a
                    start or a due date on any of the dates shown in your
                    current calendar tile, there will be an active link with a
                    short text for this item in the corresponding field.</p>

                <p class="p">In front of the text there is a small symbol which indicates
                    whether this is a start date or a due date for this item. If
                    the start date falls together with the due date, a dot is
                    displayed. If an item starts at that date, there is a little
                    bar left of the arrow. If an item is due that date, there is
                    a little bar right of the arrow.</p>

                <p class="p">When you click on the link you are taken to the item. When
                    you hover over the item, a tool tip will appear and show you
                    more information on this item.</p>
