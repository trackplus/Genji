        Language (TQL) permits to define filters including search in attached files (HTML, text,
        XML, OpenOffice, PDF, Excel) and permits to perform fuzzy and proximity
        searches.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Terms</h2>
            
            <p class="p">A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single
                Terms and Phrases.</p>

            <p class="p">A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".</p>

            <p class="p">A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".</p>

            <p class="p">Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex
                query (see below).</p>

            <p class="p">If the term consists of just a number, only the item number property is searched for
                exactly this number.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">You can use localized value terms coming from selection fields like state or
            <span class="ph">priority</span>.</div>

        <h2 class="title topictitle2">Fields in TQL</h2>

        <div class="body conbody">
            <p class="p">TQL supports fielded data. When performing a search you can either specify an property,
                or use the default property. The default property encompasses basically all textual fields
                of <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="p">You can search any property by typing the property name followed by a colon ":" and then
                the term you are looking for.</p>

            <p class="p">As an example, let's assume you want to find the item entitled "The Right Way" which
                contains the text "don't go this way", you can enter:</p>

            <pre class="pre codeblock">
Synopsis:"The Right Way" AND Description:go
</pre>

            <p class="p">or</p>

            <pre class="pre codeblock">
Synopsis:"The Right Way" AND go
</pre>

            <p class="p">Since by default all text fields are searched, in the second example items having
                "go" in another text property than Description  would qualify as well.</p>

            <p class="p">You can enter either the system internal property name ("Synopsis") or the localized
                property name as you see it in the user interface ("Title").</p>

            <p class="p">For a complete list of system fields have a look at the section on <a class="xref fm:" href="systemFields.html#id131MDE0I0HE">System
                Fields</a>.</p>

            <div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">The property is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so
                the query<pre class="pre codeblock">
Synopsis:Do it right
</pre>
<p class="p">will only find "Do" in the
                    title property. It will find "it" and "right" in the default property (in this case

            <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Wildcard Searches</h3>
                
                <p class="p">TQL supports single and multiple character wildcard searches. To perform a single
                    character wildcard search use the "?" symbol. To perform a multiple character
                    wildcard search use the "*" symbol. </p>

                <p class="p">The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the
                    single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can
                    use the search:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
te?t
</pre>

                <p class="p">Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example,
                    to search for "test", "tests" or "tester", you can use the search:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
test
</pre>

                <p class="p">You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
te*t
</pre>

                <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.</div>

                <p class="p">TQL supports fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance
                    algorithm. To do a fuzzy search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a
                    Single word Term. For example to search for a term similar in spelling to "roam"
                    use the fuzzy search:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
roam~
</pre>

                <p class="p">This search will find terms like foam and roams. An additional (optional)
                    parameter can specify the required similarity. The value is between 0 and 1,
                    with a value closer to 1 only terms with a higher similarity will be matched.
                    For example:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
roam~0.8
</pre>

                <p class="p">The default that is used if the parameter is not given is 0.5.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Proximity Searches</h3>
                
                <p class="p">TQL supports finding words that are within a specific distance away. To do a
                    proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Phrase. For example
                    to search for a "project" and "management" within 10 words of each other in a
                    item use the search:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
„project management“~10
</pre>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Range Searches</h3>
                
                <p class="p">Range Queries allow one to match items whose property(s) values are between the
                    lower and upper bound specified by the Range Query. Range Queries can be
                    inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done
                    lexicographically.</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
Lastedit:[20060101 TO 20060101]
</pre>

                <p class="p"> This will find items whose Lastedit fields have values between 20060101 and
                    20060101, inclusive. Note that Range Queries are not reserved for date fields.
                    You could also use range queries with non-date fields:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
Synopsis:{Aida TO Carmen}
</pre>

                <p class="p">This will find all items whose synopsis are between Aida and Carmen, but not
                    including Aida and Carmen.</p>

                <p class="p">Inclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range queries
                    are denoted by curly brackets.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Boosting a Term</h3>
                
                <p class="p">TQL provides the relevance level of matching items based on the terms found. To
                    boost a term use the caret, "^", symbol with a boost factor (a number) at the
                    end of the term you are searching. The higher the boost factor, the more
                    relevant the term will be.</p>

                <p class="p">Boosting allows you to control the relevance of a item by boosting its term. For
                    example, if you are searching for</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
project management
</pre>

                <p class="p">and you want the term "project" to be more relevant boost it using the ^ symbol
                    along with the boost factor next to the term. You would type:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
project^4management
</pre>

                <p class="p">This will make items with the term "project" appear more relevant. You can also
                    boost Phrase Terms as in the example:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">
"project management"^4 "TQL"
</pre>

                <p class="p">By default, the boost factor is 1. Although the boost factor must be positive, it
                    can be less than 1 (e.g. 0.2).</p>

        <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through
            logic operators. TQL supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note:

            <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">OR</h3>
                
                <p class="p">The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is
                    no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used. The OR operator
                    links two terms and finds a matching item if either of the terms exist in an
                    item. This is equivalent to a union using sets. The symbol || can be used in
                    place of the word OR.</p>

                <p class="p">To search for items that contain either "project management" or just "project"
