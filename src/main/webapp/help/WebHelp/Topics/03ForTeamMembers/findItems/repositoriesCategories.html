<h1 class="title topictitle1">Filter repositories and folders</h1>



<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can store your filters in filter repositories. You can organize each filter
repository with any number of folders, just as you are used from a file system.</p>

<p class="p">You can define any number of filters and store them in filter repositories. You can organize your
filters in folders, like date related filters, meeting filters, tracking filters, etc.</p>

<p class="p">Over time you may accumulate a certain number of useful view filters. As this list grows, you may
want to categorize the filters to better keep an overview. For example you may have special filters
for meetings, or projects, or for progress monitoring, and so on.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> permits you to structure filter repositories using folders, just as you are used from a
file system.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> provides three types of repositories to store filters in:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">a personal filter repository</li>

<li class="li">project specific filter repositories</li>

<li class="li">a system wide filter repository</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">From the public repository, you can copy view filters into your personal repository to modify
them there. You can delete your own published filters from the public repository, but not those
owned by anybody else.</p>

<div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/folders.png" height="115" width="105"/></div><br/>

</div>

<p class="p">Each user if the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system has his own, personal filter repository. Here you can store,
modify and delete filter expressions that you have developed for yourself and found useful. You can
copy some of your own, personal filters into the public repository and make them available to all
other users of the system, that share at least one project with you. This is a convenient way to
exchange filter expressions with other users in order to later on personalize them.</p>

<p class="p">If you have project administrator rights in at least one project you may add, modify and delete
filters from the project repository. Members of a project may use project specific filters and can
copy them into their own, personal repository for modification. Entries in the project specific
repository list can be filtered by project name.</p>

<p class="p">All access rights are handled such that only authorized persons can access, modify and delete
filter definitions in the repositories. To get an item overview with a certain filter, go to
the „Action“ column and click on the little tooth wheel symbol „Browse with filter“. </p>

<p class="p">If there are a lot of filters you can limit the view to a selection based on name pattern, filter
type, and repository using the little filter symbol at the top right position of the form.</p>
