    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> can receive e-mails and create from them new items or add
        information to existing items. To this end <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> acts like any standard
        e-mail client like Outlook or Thunderbird and needs to know how to
        connect to a mailbox on an POP3 or IMAP mail server.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mail server protocol</h2>
            
            <p class="p">There are two popular e-mail protocols to communicate with a
                mailbox: IMAP. Here you can select which one you prefer. Your
                server has to offer the protocol you select here. Many servers
                offer even both at the same time.</p>

            <div class="p">A good way to check is again the setting in your own e-mail
                client software.<div class="fig fignone"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id131UEH0H088__image_afy_2qw_3k" src="../figures/incomingEmail.png" height="250" width="357"/></div><br/></div>
</div>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mail server name and port</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Mailboxes are managed by mail servers. Here you enter the name of
                the mail server where the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system mailbox resides. You can
                leave this empty if you do not plan to use the item submission
                by e-mail feature, and do not require authentication by first
                reading a mailbox before sending anything.</p>

            <p class="p">Typically, you should leave the default port set (110 for POP3 or
                143 for IMAP, and 995 for POP3 via SSL/TLS and 993 for IMAP via
                SSL/TLS).</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mailbox user name and password</h2>
            
            <p class="p">All mailbox servers require you to authenticate yourself before
                retrieving any e-mails. Here you enter the user name and
                password associated with the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system e-mail inbox. Be
                careful if you try to reuse an existing, private account: you
                might loose e-mails since they would be read by the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>
                system, and it is possible that contention occurs if you are
                trying to access the mailbox from two different sessions (like
                from your private e-mail client and through the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>
                system).</p>

            <p class="p">It is therefore recommended to establish an extra e-mail account
                for the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system, unless this field is kept empty.</p>

            <p class="p">In case item e-mail submissions are enabled, this mailbox is
                regularly scanned for new e-mails. The e-mails are read, and
                items are created from each e-mail. The e-mail subject is mapped
                to the item title, the e-mail body is mapped to the item
                description, and any attachments are added to the item as item
                attachments.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Encrypted connections</h2>
            
            <p class="p">You can use an encrypted connection between your <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> server
                and your POP3 or IMAP e-mail server. You can select between SSL,
                TLS, and TLS if available.</p>

            <p class="p">For encrypted connections to work you first have to import a certificate from your
                e-mail server into your <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> server local
                keystore. How this is done is described under "<a class="xref" href="../usingEncryption.html" title="You can use encrypted connections between Genji and your e-mail server to prevent passwords from being transmitted clear text across your network.">Using SSL and TLS encryption on e-mail and LDAP connections</a>".</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">E-mail submissions</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> can be configured to accept item
                submissions
                and additions to existing items via e-mail. This can be quite
                useful if customers shall not get access to the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> database
                itself, but they should channel their requests via e-mails to a
                specific account.</p>

            <p class="p">You can enable or disable e-mail submissions to the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system
                selecting the radio buttons provided on the configuration
                screen. You can also decide if you want to accept e-mail
                submissions from users that are not registered with the system,
                or you want to limit acceptance to users that are known in
                <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> regularly scans the POP3 input box of the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> e-mail
                account provided in the upper part of the configuration screen
                for new messages and either creates new items in the default
                project you have to configure here, or adds submissions as
                comments to existing items if the subject line starts with a
                number and that number corresponds to an existing item.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Keep messages on server</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Check this if you want to keep messages on your mail server even
                though your <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> server has read them. This can be useful if
                you access the same mailbox also with an interactive client like
                Thunderbird or Outlook.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accept unknown sender</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Check this box if you want to permit unknown senders to submit
                items to the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system via e-mail. The e-mail senders
                address is still checked for compliance with the allowed domain
                patterns, but it is not required any more that the senders
                e-mail address is registered with some user within the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>
                system.</p>

            <p class="p">Be careful when you expose <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> to the internet, leaving the
                wildcard domain pattern at the same time, which is the default.
                This could result in spamming your <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> installation.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">E-mail default project</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When e-mail item
                submission has been enabled, there has to be a project the
                incoming items can be assigned to. This could be some kind of
                „catch all“ project, from where the items are regularly
                transferred to their final points of destination. Typically, one
                or two people monitor this catch all project, and take action
                when items come in.</p>

            <p class="p">Each project can have their own e-mail inbox configured, if it
                likes to do so. In this case the global e-mail inbox might be
                obsolete.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Allowed domain pattern</h2>
            
            <p class="p">To prevent users from unverified domains (e.g. hotmail.com,
                gmx.com) to register, a Perl5 regular expression can be defined
                so that only e-mail domains matching that expression are allowed
                to register. You most likely will have to change the example
                default on the site configuration page.</p>

            <p class="p">Example pattern: </p>

            <p class="p">
                <samp class="ph codeph"> [^@ \t]@bosch\.com </samp>
            </p>

            <p class="p">This example permits just users from domain
                    „<samp class="ph codeph">bosch.com</samp>“ to register. Some more
                examples:</p>

            <p class="p">
                <samp class="ph codeph"> [^@ \t]@t-online\.de|[^@ \t]@computer\.org </samp>
            </p>

            <p class="p">matches all users from domains <samp class="ph codeph">t-online.de</samp> and
                    <samp class="ph codeph">computer.org</samp>. The pattern</p>

            <p class="p">
                <samp class="ph codeph"> \w[-.\w]+\@[-.\w]+\.\w{2,3} </samp>
            </p>

            <p class="p">matches all e-mail domains with no restrictions.</p>
