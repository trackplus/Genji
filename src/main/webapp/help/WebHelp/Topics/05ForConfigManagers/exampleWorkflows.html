    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This section presents some examples for useful workflows.
        The examples are based on the standard <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> state space
        and role definitions.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Action item list</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The action item list is the most general in the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system. It was designed and developed to
                help facilitate communication within groups as small as members of a project or as
                large as members of an entire organization. In today's world, action items levied
                against members of an organization are created from several different sources
                through various avenues (either by email, voice mail, in meetings, or by word of
                mouth) resulting in actions not being completed because either the action was
                forgotten, misplaced, or miscommunicated.</p>

            <p class="p">The intent of the action item list is to:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">centralize and organize all action items for a particular organization or
                    project</li>

                <li class="li">make the system available through the Internet, and notify individuals via email
                    when an action is assigned to them or is nearing or has surpassed the due
                    date</li>

                <li class="li">allow for a concise and up to date overview on a projects state</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">Not all states the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system has to offer are
                helpful when dealing with action items. The figure below shows the state subset that
                could be used for action items.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id31exampleWorkflows__image_cvx_dsv_3k" src="workflows/figures/wf-actionItem.png" height="53" width="149"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">An action item is created and initially set to state „opened“. Action items should
                always carry a due date and a person to which they are assigned. This is unavoidable
                in the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system. </p>

            <p class="p">Once work on an action item has started the state is set to „processing“ by the
                current responsible. This permits other people to see that something is actually
                happening regarding this item. The item can be closed by the responsible or a
                manager once all tasks associated with this action have been completed.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Milestone tracking</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In a well managed project, there will be lots of binary milestones, those that are
                either passed or not passed. It is an often observed project sickness that
                milestones are not defined in a binary fashion. You will hear people coming up with
                terms like „conditionally passed“, „90% done“, „almost there“ and so on. If you hear
                such phrases you know you are in trouble.</p>

            <p class="p">It is in the nature of a milestone that you have either passed it or not. It may take
                some effort to define project milestones, but it pays well. The best milestones are
                connected to assessable, 100% complete results. For example, a good milestone would
                be „customer requirements reviewed with customer and frozen“. A bad example would be
                „customer requirements 50% finished“.</p>

            <p class="p">A milestone has to have a due date associated with it. It can be either „opened“ or
                „closed“. The state transition from „opened“ to „closed“ marks the passing of the
                milestone.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id31exampleWorkflows__image_gbh_yrv_3k" src="workflows/figures/wf-milestone.png" height="38" width="151"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">It is quite common that the milestone passing dates, as envisioned in the first
                project plan, have to be moved. In a badly managed project such movements become
                visible only at the milestone due date, or worse, at the next quality gate. With <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> it is no problem to move a due date, but
                the change is recorded and you can watch how a milestone slips. Looking at the
                database, you can draw reports of milestone slippage in your project, telling you
                quite clearly where you stand.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk Management</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Planning a project and then executing the plan is based on estimates. Unless you have
                a magic crystal ball you are making assumptions that could or could not be true. One
                definition for an estimate calls it a prediction that is equally likely to be above
                or below the actual result. Estimate uncertainty occurs because an estimate is a
                probabilistic assessment of a future condition.</p>

            <p class="p">The many events that could lead to your estimate being too optimistic I call risks.
                There could be a risk that you won't be able to meet the schedule, or the budget, or
                the expected quality level. You may not be able to get the right people at the
                required time. A supplier you are counting on falls short to deliver on his
                contract. You may depend on weather conditions, and they turn out to not being in
                your favor. It's up to your imagination what could happen.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id31exampleWorkflows__image_kcf_gsv_3k" src="workflows/figures/wf-risk.png" height="53" width="149"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">Managing a project to a good extent means managing risks. It is very helpful to
                always have a list with the ten most prevalent risks in your project. You should
                have a strategy available on how to react if any of these risks materializes. The
                    <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system helps you to manage a list of
                risks. There may be more than just ten risks. Enter all you know, and assign them to
                the different <span class="ph">priority</span> and <span class="ph">severity</span> levels. This permits to draw reports with those
                risks that are most likely to occur, or that have the greatest impact. Use the
                <span class="ph">priority</span> to describe the probability of occurrence, and the <span class="ph">severity</span> to describe the
                possible impact. The most critical risks are those that have the highest probability
                of occurrence and the largest impact.</p>

            <p class="p">There are only two states for a risk: it is either „opened“ or „closed“. Status
                „closed“ means the probability of this risk occurring in the future is zero. Reasons
                to close a risk could be that there is no future for your project, because it has
                been closed, or that the risk already occurred, or that you absolutely can rule out
                that the risk could ever come up again.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Item lists</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In the software business this is also called the „bug list“. Unlike milestones and
                action items, items are usually not planned, but they will occur. For large
                projects, and particularly in software projects, from the beginning to the end there
                will be many items. From our experience, for an embedded system with about 100.000
                non commented lines of code you may have to handle about 2500 items before you can
                ship your system. Since it is close to impossible to control such an amount of items
                without any tool support, bug tracking systems have been on the market for quite
                some time.</p>

            <p class="p">The <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system is well suited to act as an item
                or bug tracker. Compared to other systems it supports well large organizations with
                many projects, due to its technology and access control features. Except for access
                control the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> system imposes very few
                restrictions on its users. This leads to fast adoption and intense usage even
                without organizational policy enforcement.</p>

            <p class="p">The life of an item starts with state „opened“. Anybody with appropriate permission
                in a specific project can create a new item. There is a default person assigned as
                manager of an item who is responsible to evaluate and possibly assign it to somebody
                for further investigation or resolution.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id31exampleWorkflows__image_ykn_5rv_3k" src="workflows/figures/wf-issue.png" height="133" width="237"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">If there is a time gap between the decision to further pursue this item and the time
                it can be assigned to somebody for resolution it is possible to mark an item as
                „analyzed“. If the analysis shows that resolution of an item should be deferred to
                some later time the item can be set to „suspended“. From this state it can always be
                reopened, or directly be assigned to some person for further processing.</p>

            <p class="p">To permit management some insight when an item is actually being worked upon by the
                person responsible for it, state „processing“ is available. This state marks the
                period during which resolution of an item is pursued. While most other states
                describe the end of a period, this state describes the process. The end of this
                period is marked by state „implemented“, which means that resolution has been
                completed, but no integration and tests have been carried out.</p>

            <p class="p">The integrators and testers can use state „integrated“, „assessing“, and „closed“. If
                the integration and assessment process reveals no further problems with the
                implemented item resolution, the item can be closed. In any other case, the item is
                being set back to „assigned“.</p>

            <p class="p">As with state „processing“, state „assessing“ defines a process rather than the end
                of a process. This again is to enable management visibility when the assessment
                process, which could take some time, has actually been started.</p>
