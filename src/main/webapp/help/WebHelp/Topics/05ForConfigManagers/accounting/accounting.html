    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> permits to budget and track times and
        expenses for items. To this purpose, the system
        provides accounts and cost centers. All expenses are accumulated in accounts, and each
        account belongs to a cost center. Projects write their expenses against those accounts that
        they are permitted to use.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accounting overview</h2>
            
            <p class="p">There may be as many
                accounts in the
                system as required. Accounts may assume states; for example they can be open, so
                authorized people can place their expenses on them, or they can be closed, and it
                will not be possible any more to write expenses against them.</p>

            <p class="p">A single account may belong to one or more projects. For example, there may be
                accounts for common tasks or overheads like department meetings, vacation, illness,
                etc.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/costCenterAccount.png" height="129" width="211"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> is not a bookkeeping system. However, it is
                easy to connect an enterprise management system like SAP or Oracle to the
                information stored in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>. In this case it has
                to be made sure that the account and cost center numbers in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span>match those in the bookkeeping system.</p>

            <p class="p">Accounting can be enabled for each project separately. So if a project manager does
                not require accounting and budgeting for
                his project, this function can be disabled.</p>

            <p class="p">Cost centers can be deleted; in this case their accounts are being transferred to a
                replacement cost center.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting up accounting</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The first step in enabling accounting is to create cost centers. <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Genji</span></span> associates but little information with
                cost centers: a unique number which should match that of the larger bookkeeping
                software, if available, and a name. Oftentimes cost centers correspond to
                departments.</p>

            <p class="p">The second step is to create accounts. Accounts carry four properties:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">a unique account number</li>

                <li class="li">a name</li>

                <li class="li">a cost center</li>

                <li class="li">a state</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">The account number should match that of the bookkeeping system being used. The
                account name can be any string and should briefly describe the purpose of the
                account. Each account is assigned to exactly one cost center. The person responsible
                for the cost center thereby is also the person responsible for the account.</p>

            <p class="p">Each account has a state. The state determines if the account can be actively used,
                or if the account is closed. If the account is closed it will not appear any more in
                the selection boxes when users need to record their expenses.</p>

            <p class="p">Accounts can be deleted; however their entire history has then to be mapped to
                another account that still exists.</p>

            <p class="p">Accounts can accumulate either monetary expenses (cost) or time expenses (efforts).
                Each project defines the base currency for the monetary costs. Their can be
                different base currencies for different projects. The base „currency“ for time
                expenses is one working hour. Working days are mapped to working hours by the values
                found in either the project type definition, the project definition, or a single
                users definition for how many hours one working has.</p>

            <p class="p">The third step in setting up accounting for a project is to assign the accounts
                defined previously to the projects. It is possible to assign a single account to
                more than one project. It is also possible to disconnect accounts from projects.</p>
