    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Managing workflows</h1>

    
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can define workflows that specify who can perform state transitions on items and
        what happens together with such state transitions. You can associate scripts with workflow
        state transitions that perform arbitrary actions and checks. </p>

        <p class="p">To add or edit workflows go to <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Administration</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Customize</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Workflows</span></span>.</p>

        <div class="fig fignone"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id132LE0Z0163__image_ljc_53s_kk" src="figures/workflow1.png" height="290" width="422"/></div><br/>
            
            <p class="p">In the second column from the left you see the standard <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>hierarchical configuration scheme.
                You assign workflows to item types, workspace types and spaces by dragging them from
                the grid on the right to the appropriate node on the left. Workflows are inherited
                from global assignments to the most detailed assignment for a specific item type in
                a specific space.</p>

            <p class="p">You can overwrite a workflow at a lower level by assigning another workflow there.
                You can revert to the inherited assignment by resetting that node.</p>

            <div class="p">To add a workflow click on "Add" in the small toolbar. Enter a name, an optional tag
                in case you have a lot of workflows and you want to be able to group and categorize
                them, and an optional description. Then save the workflow.<div class="fig fignone"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id132LE0Z0163__image_og3_2ms_kk" src="figures/workflow2.png" height="154" width="307"/></div><br/>
                    
                </div>
</div>

            <div class="p">To define the workflow select in the grid and click on "Configure" in the small
                toolbar. A graphical editor window is opened.<div class="fig fignone"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id132LE0Z0163__image_hvx_fms_kk" src="figures/workflow3.png" height="330" width="516"/></div><br/>
                    
                </div>
</div>

            <p class="p">Initially you will drag a number of states from area A to area B. There is a special
                start state that is outside of your regular set of states. The transition from that
                start state to another state in your workflow diagram is taken when an item is
                created. This is useful in case you want to assign this item initially to somebody
                depending on item data like keywords or tags. This also works when items are created
                by e-mail submission.</p>

            <p class="p">You can connect states by transitions. To draw a transition select the transition
                symbol in the small toolbar, click on the source node and drag the line to the
                target node. You can change the shape of the transition by moving its handles (shown
                as "C") in the figure above.</p>

            <div class="p">You can associate a transition with four entities:<ul class="ul" id="id132LE0Z0163__ul_vbw_k4s_kk">
                <li class="li">An event triggering that transition</li>

                <li class="li">Activities that are executed when the transition is taken</li>

                <li class="li">Guards that can prevent the transition from taking place.</li>

            </ul>
In the following section these entities are described in more detail.</div>

        </div>

        
        <div class="section" id="id132LE0Z0163__esctrigger"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Triggering event</h2>
            
            <p class="p">A transition is fired or initiated by a triggering event. The following events are predefined in
                <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>:</p>

            <ul class="ul"> <li class="li">An explicit user action
                <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Edit item</li>

                <li class="li">Change item state</li>

                <li class="li">Copy item</li>

                <li class="li">Move item to new item type or space</li>

                <li class="li">Add child item</li>

                </ul>
</li>

                <li class="li">A timeout based on the last explicit user action</li>

                <li class="li">A timeout based on the last status change</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">A state change action implies that source and target state are different. In all other cases
                the source and target state may be the same. For example, you could perform checks on an item when
                it is edited. Or you could automatically change an item property if the responsible was changed. Or
                you could automatically change assign the responsible person for a child item. In principle there
                are no limits on what you can do when an item is modified.</p>

            <p class="p">You associate a triggering action with a transition by first selecting the transition (C) and
                then selecting the action (F).</p>

        </div>

        
        <div class="section" id="id132LE0Z0163__wfguards"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Guards</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Once a transition is fired, an optional guard condition has to be met for the
                transition to really take place. If the guard condition is false, the transition is
                rejected. You associate a guard with a transition by first selecting the transition
                (C) and then adding the desired guard conditions (D). </p>

            <p class="p">A number of guard conditions are available:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">A role the person initiating this transition via an action must have in the
                    space the item belongs to</li>

                <li class="li">A specific person</li>

                <li class="li">A workflow guard script</li>

                <li class="li">An automail condition (see <a class="xref" href="../automail/automailCondition.html" title="You can further filter automails generated from triggers by assigning automail conditions. With these filters you can control down to each item property what kind of messages you will get from your Track+ Service Desk system when items are created or modified.">Automail conditions</a>)</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">If you specify a number of guards, if any of the guards is true the transition will
                be taken.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section" id="id132LE0Z0163__wfactivities"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Transition activities</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When a transition is taken, associated activities are executed. You associate
                transition activities with a transition by first selecting the transition (C) and
                then adding the desired activities (E).</p>

            <p class="p">A number of transition activities are available</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Changing any item property like responsible, manager, or status</li>

                <li class="li">Sending an e-mail based on an e-mail template</li>

                <li class="li">Executing a workflow activity script</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">With a workflow activity script you can basically do anything conceivable, creating
                child items, copying project templates, and so on.</p>

            <p class="p">When you select an item property change activity you can put a parameter into the
                workflow instead of a concrete value. When you assign such a workflow to a workspace
                or item type or workspace type you can then assign a real value.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section" id="id132LE0Z0163__wfstates"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">States</h2>
            
            <p class="p">A workflow is described mostly by states and transitions between states. In addition
                to the states you have defined in your system, there are two more states available
                in the workflows editor.</p>

            <p class="p">The initial state is the one where an item is in after it has been created and before
                it is saved. For example,if you permit to create items by e-mail you could add
                guards and activities to that transition which based on the submitters e-mail
                address would assign the item to a specific workspace or responsible.</p>

            <p class="p">The transition to the final state is taken when an item is deleted. This is not
                enabled right now.</p>
