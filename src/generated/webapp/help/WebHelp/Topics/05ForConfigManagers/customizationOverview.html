    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Customization overview</h1>

    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> can be
        customized and adapted to your processes to a large extend. This includes roles, item types,
        workflows, item fields, action forms, and much more.</p>

        <p class="p">As shipped, the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> configuration may suite already
            many requirements, in particular for the development of software based system. This
            section describes and discusses the various options when configuring <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> to adapt to your processes.</p>

        <p class="p">One of the most important parts of running projects with a group of people is to define
            who is supposed to do what, how things should be done, and how things should be named.
            This can be either communicated ad hoc, as a particular situation requires, or it can be
            defined as a company or project policy.</p>

        <p class="p">We recommend to write up the most important aspects, for example as part of a project
            handbook or configuration management manual. In many cases it also suffices to implement
            policies in the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> system; however, the semantics
            of names may not always be self explanatory and should be described where project team
            members can find it.</p>

        <p class="p">It would be nice if there was the one and only right process. Unfortunately there is not.
            We therefore can just give some examples, and outline the general procedures, hoping
            that this might be helpful enough to get you started. If you have no idea, using the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> default configuration should be a pretty good
            start. You can always change the process later on, if you feel that the default process
            model of <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> does not suit your needs.</p>

        <p class="p">If you cannot get started on this, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> provides
            process consulting on various levels through its consultant network. For example, we
            would discuss your needs and project environment, and would supply a project manual, a
            configuration manual, and a <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> configuration
            exactly matching your requirements. </p>
