    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Configuration scenarios</h1>

    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This section gives examples of configuration scenarios,
        pertaining to roles and permissions, item types, and workflows.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Customers and developers</h2>
            
            <p class="p">A common scenario is to grant customers access to the system but in a way that they
                only see their own entries. Developers should be able to see all entries, including
                internally generated tasks. There are three ways to accomplish this setup in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span>:</p>

            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">Customers are assigned to role „Extern“. This way they can only see their own
                    items. A disadvantage may be that entries from this customers are not grouped.
                    If there are several people associated with this customer, each can only see his
                    own entries, but not those of his peers from the same company. If each customer
                    is granted a collective account, this usually poses no problem though.</li>

                <li class="li">If there is only a limited amount of customers, a list is created for each
                    customer. Only people associated with this customer and developers are granted
                    access to this list. Customers may now have extended rights to this list, and
                    all people associated with this customer may see all tasks in this list.</li>

                <li class="li">A separate project is created for each customer. Internal developers can access
                    all projects, while customers can only access their specific project. This
                    permits to use the finer classification of different lists even with many
                    different customers.</li>

            </ol>

            <p class="p">Each solution has its distinct advantages, and it depends on the number of customers
                and how one likes to interface the system with the customer which solution is
                preferable.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Anonymous access</h2>
            
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p class="p">To permit anonymous access to the system create an account „anonymous“ or use the
                predefined „guest“ account with no password or a public password and grant this user
                all access rights desired. Public passwords may for example published on the login
                page.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Personal To Do list</h2>
            
            <p class="p">It is possible to configure <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> such that you
                have your personal to do list that is not visible to others. There are three ways
                how to achieve this. One solution is to define a new project, e.g. named „Personal“,
                and assign each user the „Extern“ role. This permits you to create, modify and close
                items that only you can see.</p>

            <p class="p">The second approach is to define a new item type „personal items“ and define via
                access restriction on the access permission page that only role „Extern“ can access
                this list.</p>

            <p class="p">The third approach is to use the privacy flag on items you want to hide. You can set
                this flag when creating items, or later on when you modify your own items. It is not
                possible to set the privacy flag on items you have not originated.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Small development teams, lean, informal</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Here is an example for a lean configuration. This works very well for small teams, in
                open cultures with less formal approaches.</p>

            <p class="p">The following item types are used:</p>

            <div class="p">
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">tasks</li>

                    <li class="li">mile stones</li>

                </ul>

            </div>

            <p class="p">You may delete all other item types.</p>

            <p class="p">You can use the default priorities and severities.</p>

            <p class="p">The following states are being used:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">opened</li>

                <li class="li">suspended</li>

                <li class="li">closed</li>

                <li class="li">processing</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">There should be no workflows configured; thus it is possible to go from any state to
                any other state. All team members shall have role „responsible“.This will give you a
                solid yet open process which is very efficient for small teams.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Large development teams, lean, formal</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Here is an example for a lean but more formal configuration. This works very well for
                larger teams where it may be necessary to restrict state changes to certain people,
                e.g. that only a tester can close an item, or that marketing should not see bugs
                only known to the developers.</p>

            <p class="p">The following item types are used:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">tasks</li>

                <li class="li">problem reports</li>

                <li class="li">request for enhancements</li>

                <li class="li">mile stones</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">You may delete all other item types.</p>

            <p class="p">You can use the default priorities and severities.</p>

            <p class="p">The following states are being used:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">opened</li>

                <li class="li">analyzed</li>

                <li class="li">assigned</li>

                <li class="li">suspended</li>

                <li class="li">testing</li>

                <li class="li">closed</li>

                <li class="li">processing</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">Item type access should be constrained to the specific roles; for example marketing
                shall only be able to see mile stones and requests for enhancements, developers
                should be able to see everything.</p>

            <p class="p">There should be reasonably open workflows configured. In general, any state
                transition shall be possible with a few exceptions. You should ask yourself not „who
                should be able to carry out this transition?“ but rather „is there any reason that
                not anybody could carry out this transition?“. This will lead to a more practical
                workflow than if you just go ahead and consider the „good“ case, not taking into
                account the many exceptions that might happen in the course of a project.</p>
