    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> has built in
        system properties, and you can add any number of custom properties.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Properties and fields</h2>In <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> we
            distinguish between properties and fields. Properties belong to items, and fields belong
            to forms or input masks. On a form there is a field for an item property. However,
            items can have properties that are not visible on a form.<div class="p">
                <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you want to use an property, you have to place it on an input form so that
                    it can be accessed (see <a class="xref" href="../forms/cCustomForms.html" title="You can layout and design your own input masks, specific for each action type, like create, edit, add comment, and so on. You can assign forms you have created globally, or for each item type, project type, or even project. For example, you can have a very simple form for items of type „mile stone“, and a complex mask for items of type „problem report“.">Customizing forms</a>).</div>

            </div>
<p class="p">All properties are global, but their properties like label, tool tip, and
                selection list can be overwritten </p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">for each item type</li>

                <li class="li">for each workspace type and item type</li>

                <li class="li">for each workspace and item type</li>

            </ul>
<p class="p">Property properties are „inherited“ down the hierarchy: system, item type,
                workspace type, and workspace. A workspace manager may define or overwrite custom
                properties only at the workspace level. For more information have a look at <a class="xref" href="../../02KeyConcepts/Config/configInheritance.html" title="Configurations can be set at various levels: globally, item type specific, workspace type specific, and workspace specific.">Configuration inheritance</a>.</p>
<p class="p">This approach
                fosters reuse of existing custom property definitions across many workspaces, makes
                it easy to change configurations globally while preserving full flexibility down to
                each workspace.</p>
<p class="p">The figure below shows at the top the global configuration.
                When defining system and custom properties at this level, all workspaces and item
                types will automatically inherit this configuration, unless they overwrite it
                locally.</p>
<p class="p">The item type specific configuration permits to define system and
                custom properties differently for each item type. If things are configured here, in
                all workspaces for these item types this configuration will be visible.</p>

            </div>
<p class="p">The next figure shows configuration at a workspace type level. Here you can
                define for each workspace type and item type system and custom properties.</p>

<p class="p">All workspaces of this workspace type will automatically inherit this
                configuration.</p>
<p class="p">The figure below shows a configuration at a workspace level.
                Here you can define for each workspace and item type system and custom
                properties.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">System properties</h2><p class="p">System properties are the properties that are built into <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>. Many of the system properties have some logic associated with them, like the
                author property, the manager property, the responsible property, the item type
                property, and so on. For an overview on all system properties have a look at
                <a class="xref" href="../../03ForTeamMembers/findItems/systemFields.html">System properties</a>.</p>
<p class="p">These properties always exist, even though they may not appear at the user interface. You can
                overwrite the labels and tool tips of these properties at each of the levels
                mentioned above, thus permitting you some limited customization.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Custom properties</h2><p class="p">As a system or workspace administrator you can define new properties. An property has an
                property type, like text  or date. If you want to define properties offering a
                selection list, you first have to create the selection list before you define the
                property.</p>
<p class="p">Custom
                properties do not automatically appear at the user interface. You have to explicitly
                place them on at least one custom form before they become visible to
            users.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deprecated and required properties</h2><p class="p">All
                properties can be marked as deprecated or required. </p>
<p class="p">Deprecated properties
                cannot be selected anymore from the property selection list when managing input
                forms. They are still in the database, but they cannot be used anymore when
                designing new forms.</p>
<div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/deprecated.png" height="38" width="154"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>
<p class="p">If an property is marked as required, users have to enter information for this property when an
                item is created. If they do not enter information, an error message is displayed.
                The „required“ property pertains only to creating items.</p>
<div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/required.png" height="86" width="134"/></div><br/>
                    
            </div>
<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">It is possible to create problematic configurations that prevent the user from
                creating new items. If an property is marked as required, but does not appear on
                the associated input mask for this workspace and item type, the user will not be
                able to create an item.</div>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Property names</h2><p class="p">Each property has a name. This name is used in the full text search index. When an property
                name is changed, this change is always global, even for properties that have been
                derived, or have been overwritten at the workspace, workspace type, or item type
                level.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Label and tool tip</h2>Each property has a label and a tool tip
            property. The label property is the one shown at the user interface as the label for
            this property. The tool tip property will be displayed as a tool tip when hovering
            over the property.</div>
