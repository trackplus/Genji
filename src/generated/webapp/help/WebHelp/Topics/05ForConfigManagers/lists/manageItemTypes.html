                <p class="p">For a small organization, running small projects, or for use as a simple bug
                    tracking system it would suffice to configure just one item type. It is up to
                    you to decide if you for example would benefit from distinguishing between a
                    problem report and a bug. If you think you don’t, you don’t have to bother
                    setting up different item types.</p>

                <p class="p">On the other hand, you may want to use <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span>
                    to improve your process. In this case it may make a difference whether you have
                    a lot of problem reports, or if you have a lot of bugs. A problem report could
                    come from bad documentation, insufficient user training, or a badly designed
                    user interface. A bug is if your developers did not implement the specification
                    correctly. So you may have to improve different areas of your process, depending
                    on whether there is a one to one relation between bugs and problem reports, or
                    there many more problem reports than bugs. </p>

                <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> comes with a set of default item types
                    as shown in the table below. You can safely delete those you do not need, or
                    rename them to something more appropriate to your requirements. This you can do
                    even later on. If you then delete item
                    types, items of this type will then be mapped to one of those types you
                    keep.</p>

                    system offers. You can limit the set of states for each project type and item
                    type. For example, for milestone lists two states might suffice: opened and
                    closed. We will later on explain how to assign property option values to item types
                    and project types.</p>

                <p class="p">During the life-cycle of an item, it is quite common that it changes its type. For

                        each entry. You can furthermore assign a CSS style to each entry, which will
                        be used to format items in the item navigator. For example, you could use
                        various shades of red as background color to illustrate the urgency of an
                        item. You can drag entries in the list on the right to another position. The
                        entries will be offered at the user interface in the same order as shown in
                        the grid here.</div>

                        change may not be reflected at the user
                        interface! This happens when you have specific localizations for the
                        selection entries, which is the case for all predefined entries.
                        In this case the localized values will be shown and not the label
                        you define here.</div>
