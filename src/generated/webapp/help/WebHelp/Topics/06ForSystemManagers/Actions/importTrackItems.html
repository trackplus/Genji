<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can import data from another <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span>
installation, for example to merge two different installations. This is a
powerful and potentially dangerous operation, and therefore enabled only for
system administrators. This sections describes how to proceed and what happens
during the process.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview</h2>
   
   <div class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> permits you to import items and all associated data
        from another <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> instance. In the following we will
        call the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> instance that provides the data
          <span class="q">"source"</span>, and the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> installation that gets
        this data and makes it part of its own database <span class="q">"target"</span>.<div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/importmerge2.png" height="116" width="300"/></div><br/>
          
        </div>
</div>

   <p class="p">To copy data from one <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> instance to another you first have to export this data at the
     <span class="q">"source"</span>. To define the set of items to be exported you execute a regular query, and
    „export“ the result from the item navigator. Note that you can copy entire spaces this way, or
    just parts of a spaces, and even all spaces of the <span class="q">"source"</span>.</p>

   <p class="p">The <span class="q">"export"</span> process creates a ZIP data file including all data and attachments which you
        can import into the <span class="q">"target"</span> installation.</p>

  </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Export</h2>
   
   <p class="p">To prepare for an export, observe the following:</p>

   <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">You must be logged in as a user with system administrator or system manager rights (e.g.,
       <span class="q">"admin"</span> user)</p>

    </li>

    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">You must have at least read access for each project from which you want to export items. For
      this you need to assign yourself a role in these projects.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">You can only export items and related data via regular queries. This means that you will not
      be able to export items from releases that have been archived. Such releases will not show up
      in the selection boxes of the query definition any more.</p>

    </li>

   </ul>

   <p class="p">To export items and all related data first define a filter. For example, if you want to export
    all items from all projects, select the projects and deselect all other selection in all other
    boxes. Select if you want to include archived and deleted items, or for example you want to
    include only archived and deleted items to archive them somewhere else. Apply the filter. The
    result will be shown in the item navigator. </p>

   </div>

   <p class="p">Select the <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Action</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Export</span></span> menu in the tool bar. A download box will appear after a brief moment.</p>

   </div>

   <p class="p">Save the file to your local disc drive. In our example, this file has a size of about 9 MByte.
    The size very much depends on the size of the attachments. This file can be imported into
    another <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> instance.</p>

  </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Import</h2>

<p class="p">To import data from another <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> instance you have to be logged in with
system administrator privileges, e.g., as <span class="q">"admin"</span> user.</p>

<div class="p">
<div class="dangertitle">DANGER</div><div class="note danger">Importing data from another <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> instance is a potentially
dangerous operation, since it may add a lot of users and configuration items
such as fields and lists you do not want to have.</div>

</div>

<p class="p">Please also consider the following:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">Input forms and form assignments are not being imported. This means that you
may not see some fields that are visible in the exporting instance of
<span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span>.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> tries to match all data from the other instance to
                            avoid duplication of any entries. Users are identified by the
                            combination of their login name and e-mail. Only if both match users are
                            considered to be the same. Most other items are matched by their
                            universal unique identifier (UUID). Custom list entries are matched by
                            their labels. Items are not matched by their item numbers, but by their
                            UUIDs.</p>

                                                  <p class="p">Item numbers most likely get moved in the
