            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> stores a number of items on disk rather
                than in its database. You should set the following directory entries to an absolute
                path and you must make sure that they can be written to by the user that runs the
                application server (e.g., tomcat7 on an Ubuntu/Debian system with Tomcat 7):</p>

            <dl class="dl">
                
                    <dt class="dthd"><strong>Name</strong></dt>

                    <dd class="ddhd"><strong>Description</strong></dd>

                
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">TRACKPLUS_HOME</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">At this location <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> stores among
                        other things attachments and report templates. Make sure there is sufficient
                        disk space available and that this is an absolute path.</dd>

                
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">Backup directory</dt>

                    <dd class="dd"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> can create regularly backups of
                        its database and all other data. Such backups are stored in this
                        directory.</dd>

                
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">Full text search index</dt>

                    <dd class="dd"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> keeps the indices for full text
                        search on the file system, in specially formatted files and directories. The
                        indices can grow quite large. Here you should provide sufficient disk space
                        to keep the indices on. Also keep in mind that with each search and each
                        save of an item this index is touched. We therefore recommend to have a high
                        bandwidth connection between the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>
                        server and the machine managing the index disk space to keep both on the
                        same machine.</dd>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Force <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> server URL</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> has been designed to operate in a proxy
                environment, that is it works well even when its address from the outside is
                different from the internal address. </p>

            <p class="p">Usually, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> extracts its base URL from the
                first access to the system after server startup. </p>

            <div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">If you access the system using „localhost“, which you may be
                tempted to do as a system administrator, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>
                will use „localhost“  as its base address until the 
                next application restart. This
                will cause problems 
                when other people iare accessing the system from some other
                computer. You thus should always access the system using its real address, as seen
                from the outside.</div>

            <p class="p">The automatic base URL detection works fine if there are no proxy servers between the
                application server and the user clients. If there is a proxy server hiding the
                application server, the correct server URL has to be configured.</p>

            <p class="p">The application name must not be included, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>
                will find that out itself. Example for the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>
                server URL:</p>

            <p class="p">
                <samp class="ph codeph"> http://gandalf </samp>
            </p>

            <p class="p">This will work for an installation where the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> application can be reached under</p>

            <samp class="ph codeph"> http://gandalf/track </samp>
            <p class="p">or</p>

            <samp class="ph codeph"> http://gandalf/track-dev </samp>
            <p class="p">or any other application name you might have chosen. In non-proxied environments, you
                can leave this field empty, which will enable the automatic detection feature for
                the server URL.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Configuring self registration</h2>
            
            <p class="p">It is possible to permit users to register themselves. This can decrease the burden
                on the system administrator. Registration is always limited to certain e-mail domain
                patterns, as configured under „Allowed e-mail pattern“ in the incoming e-mail
                configuration section.</p>

            <p class="p">Even if users register themselves, the system administrator is the only one that can
                assign employee numbers and departments to accounts.</p>

            <p class="p">Project administrators have to grant users access to their projects, otherwise users
                will not be able to access any project data.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Automatic guest login</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When turned on, access to any system URL automatically logs the guest user into the
                system. This is convenient if you want to make queries publicly accessible without
                requiring users to have an account.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Workspace specific item number</h2>
            
            <p class="p">For each item <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> generates a unique and global
                identification number like 4789 or 6789. If you turn on the project specific item
                numbering, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> will generate instead item
                numbers composed of a project specific prefix and a project specific integer, like
                TRA-1, TRA-2, and so on.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Summary items behavior</h2>
            
            <p class="p">This activates automated computation of start date, end date, and planned value for
                summary items from their child items values. If not set parent or summary items can
                have dates and planned values independent of their children, which in most cases is
                probably not what you want.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Activate top-down support</h2>
            
            <p class="p">This enables support for top-down planning of budgets and dates. The top-down values
                are compared with the bottom-up values and conflicts are marked. For example, if the
                budget was 100 Euro, and the planned value entered by the responsible was 130 Euro,
                this item would be marked being in a conflict state. For more information have a
                look at „<a class="xref" href="../../02KeyConcepts/Planning/bottomUp.html" title="In many organizations planning is a recursive process, with desired deadlines and budgets coming from the top, and estimated expenses and delivery dates coming from those that actually do the work.">Bottom-up and top-down</a>“.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Configuring site as demo site</h2>
            
            <p class="p">This is a switch to make installation of a demo site easy. In a demo site it is not
                possible to save changes to the guest user account. Usually this should be
                disabled.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alert of new software version</h2>
            
            <p class="p">This displays a message in the state line when there is a newer program version
                available than the one you are running. The message is only shown to system
                administrators.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Webservice activation</h2>
            
            <p class="p">You can activate the web service interface which is being used by external software
                like Eclipse Mylyn and Hudson/Jenkins. The address under which you can reach the web
                service is the URL of your instance amended by
                    <samp class="ph codeph">services/TrackplusService</samp>. Example:</p>

            <pre class="pre codeblock">
https://www.trackplus.net/services/TrackplusService
</pre>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Automated data backup</h2>
            
            <p class="p">This turns on regular automated data backups. The number and frequency of backups you
                can configure on the data backup configuration page (see <a class="xref fm:" href="../databackup.html#id31backup" title="A system administrator can backup all data from the database and optionally all attachments into a ZIP archive file. Furthermore it is possible to create such backups automatically on a regular basis.
