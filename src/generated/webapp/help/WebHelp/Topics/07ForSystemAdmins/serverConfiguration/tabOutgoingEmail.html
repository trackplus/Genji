<h1 class="title topictitle1">Outgoing e-mail connection</h1>



<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> can send e-mails to notify users of events within
<span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span>. To this end <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> acts like any standard e-mail client
like Outlook or Thunderbird and needs to know how to connect to
an SMTP server.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> SMTP user</h2><div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/tabEmail1.png" height="194" width="358"/></div><br/></div>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> system can send e-mails to its users. For all system generated
e-mails, like reminder e-mails, or password e-mails, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> uses as "send from"
its own e-mail address.</p>
<p class="p">For user triggered e-mails like changing an item you can decide whether that
users e-mail should be used as the sender address or the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> system address.
You need to use the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> system address if you want responses to these e-mails
being added as comments to items.</p>
<p class="p">If
you do not want to enable item submission via e-mail, this e-mail
address does not necessarily have to have a real e-mail inbox associated
with it, it can be a „virtual“ e-mail address. You would not see
any messages sent to that address in the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> system anyway.</p>
<p class="p">If
you want to use the item submission via e-mail feature, there has
to be an e-mail inbox associated with that e-mail address.</p>
<p class="p">All
e-mails sent directly from the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> system will have as their
„from“ address the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> system e-mail address, and as the „from“
name the server name. For example, such an e-mail would appear as
coming from „Your server“ &lt;yourserver@yourdomain.com&gt;.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SMTP server name</h2><p class="p">To send e-mails,
<span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> needs to have access to an SMTP e-mail server. This e-mail
server can be located on the same machine as <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span>, or can be placed anywhere
as long as it can be directly reached. For example, it is well possible
to use an SMTP server on the internet. </p>
<p class="p">Typically, you would enter the same parameters here that you are using inside
your regular e-mail client software. You  should not use the same account, as
this may lead to access contention depending on the authentication scheme you
are using.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SMTP encrypted connections</h2><p class="p">You can use an
encrypted
connection between your <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> server and your SMTP e-mail server. You can
select between "SSL", "TLS", and "TLS if available".</p>
<p class="p">For encrypted connections you first have to import a certificate from your
SMTP server into your <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> server local keystore. How this is done is
described under "<a class="xref" href="../usingEncryption.html" title="You can use encrypted connections between Track+ and your e-mail server to prevent passwords from being transmitted clear text across your network.">Using SSL and TLS encryption on e-mail and LDAP connections</a>".</p>
</div>



<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SMTP authentication mode</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> offers
four ways you can authenticate against an SMTP Server:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">no authentication at all</li>

<li class="li">with a special user name and password for the SMTP server</li>

<li class="li">using the same user name and password as for the incoming mailbox
server</li>

<li class="li">by first connecting to the incoming mailbox server</li>
</ol>
</div>


<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SMTP user name and password</h2><p class="p">Many SMTP servers require user authentication before permitting to send
anything. Some company intranet SMTP servers may have been configured to be used
without authentication. In case you authenticate with a user/password
combination on your SMTP server, you enter the user name and your password
here.</p>

<p class="p">Click the "Clear" button to clear the password. Not entering a password will
take the old one.</p>
<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">Some SMTP servers do not like it if the „From“ address does
not match the SMTP user name. In this case you are forced to check box „Use
<span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> „From“ address“.</div>
</div>


<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mail encoding</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> can send e-mails
in a variety of encodings. Here you set the encoding such that it
matches your users preferred encoding. In the meantime, many clients
support unicode (UTF encoding). This encoding works with any language.
The setting here is typically the same as in your e-mail clients
setting. For Western languages, "ISO-8859-1" usually works fine.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SMTP server port</h2>
<p class="p"> Usually it is wise to leave the standard port set (25), since most SMTP
server use this port. If your SMTP server is located outside your companies
intranet, the firewall has to be open to permit traffic on the port configured
here. In case you are using an SSL or TLS encrypted connection, the default port
is 465. </p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Send mail from system or user account</h2><p class="p">For
events generated by users, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> can send e-mails either under
the name of the user (e.g. From: „Joe.Doe@doeJones.com“), or under
its own e-mail address (e.g. From: „Tracksystem@doeJones.com“).
You can set this parameter as you wish. However, some SMTP servers
require that the „From“ address matches the SMTP user name. In this
case you are forced to check this box.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Testing your configuration</h2>

<p class="p">You can enter your e-mail address in the field provided and send yourself an
e-mail from the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span> server to check if the configuration works.</p>

</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limiting number of simultaneous SMTP connections</h2>
        
        <p class="p">Some SMTP servers only accept a few connections from the same client. To limit the number
                of simultaneous SMTP connections by <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+</span></span>  set
            the following in the <span class="ph filepath">GeneralSettings.Properties</span> file in 
            the <span class="ph filepath">TRACKPLUS_HOME</span>
                directory:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">limitSMTPconnections=on</pre>

            <p class="p">You need to restart the server when you want to make a change here effective.</p>
