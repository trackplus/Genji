    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Cluster operation</h1>

    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> can be operated
        in a clustered environment, i.e. one <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> instance can
        run on a number of servers. This section gives examples of possible configurations and
        explains how <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> behaves in a clustered
        environment.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cluster configurations</h2>
            
            <p class="p">For web applications, there are two forms of clusters: high-availability (HA)
                clusters, and load-balancing clusters.</p>

            <p class="p">With a high-availability clusters you can improve the availability of the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> service, for example to ensure 24/7
                operation. A HA cluster operates by having redundant nodes, which are then used to
                provide service when system components fail. The most common size for an HA cluster
                is two nodes, which is the minimum requirement to provide redundancy. By using
                redundancy, HA cluster implementations eliminate single points of failure.</p>

            <p class="p">The figure below shows a simple HA cluster with two application servers and a
                database server. The database server is not redundant, but it would be possible to
                use one of the application servers as a redundant database server. The router which
                switches between application server 1 and application server 2 is not shown
                here.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id32clustering__image_afj_nxv_3k" src="figures/clustersmall.png" height="102" width="122"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">The purpose of a load-balancing clusters is to distribute a workload evenly over
                multiple back end nodes. Typically the cluster will be configured with multiple
                redundant load-balancing front ends. Since each element in a load-balancing cluster
                has to offer full service, it can be thought of as an active/active HA cluster,
                where all available servers process requests.</p>

            <p class="p">The following figure shows a rather large configuration with a load balancer, five
                application servers, two database servers, and two file servers.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="id32clustering__image_gzg_lxv_3k" src="figures/clusterlarge.png" height="160" width="198"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">All application servers operate on a single database, which is served in a redundant
                fashion via two database servers. The attachments and full text search indices are
                kept on a single file server, which also has a backup. The backup for the file
                server is left to the operating system, there is no support for this within <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="p">The database management system needs to take care of the synchronisation between the
                original database server and the backup database server.</p>

            <p class="p">All communication between different <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>
                application servers of a cluster is handled via the database. There is no need to
                open any special ports for communication between the application servers, or any
                need for using patched Java virtual machines.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> There is basically no configuration required within <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> to support operation in a clustered
                environment. If you connect several <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>
                instances to the same database, <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> will
                automatically go into cluster operation mode. You do need an appropriate license key
                though, which includes all application servers you connect to that database.</div>

            <p class="p">Many other configurations are possible. For example, one of the application servers
                can be at the same time the file server. Or the database server and file server can
                be put on the same hardware. <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> itself does
                not care about all this, as long as you ensure that you have exactly one access
                point (JDBC URL) for the database, and exactly one file path to the attachment and
                index directories for all <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> instances of
                that cluster.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Start-up behaviour</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When a <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> instance is started it registers
                itself as a node in the database. Then it checks the database for other nodes. If
                there are nodes in the database which have not updated their record during a certain
                timeout period (default is 5 minutes, can be set in file
                    <span class="ph filepath">WEB-INF/quartz-jobs.xml</span>), that entry is cleared from the
                table. </p>

            <p class="p">Thereafter <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> tries to set itself as the
                master node, unless there is already another node marked as master node. If this is
                the only node, the operation succeeds right away. Otherwise is may take as much as
                the time out period until a new master node is completely established.</p>

            <p class="p">The master node is responsible for </p>

            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">updating the full text search index</li>

                <li class="li">getting e-mails from an e-mail server, when submission of items by e-mail is
                    enabled.</li>

            </ol>

            <p class="p">In all other aspects, the master node acts like a regular node.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Master node goes down</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In case the master node goes down, the full text search facility is temporarily not
                updated. However, no activities requiring update of the full text search index get
                lost, they are stored in the database.</p>

            <p class="p">Furthermore, obtaining e-mails from the e-mail server is temporarily disabled. Again,
                no submission will get lost as they are stored on the e-mail server.</p>

            <p class="p">After at most a timeout period (default is 5 minutes, set in
                    <span class="ph filepath">WEB-INF/quartz-jobs.xml</span>) negotiation between the remaining
                nodes will begin for who will become the replacement for the original master node.
                The outcome is random. The new master node will begin to update the full text search
                index and start retrieving e-mails from the e-mail server.</p>

            <p class="p">Thus, the drop out of a master node will result in slightly decreased performance,
                and a lag of about 5 minutes in updating the full text search index.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Regular node goes down</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In case a regular node goes down there will be some decrease in performance. The
                other nodes will need less than the timeout period (default is 5 minutes, set in
                    <span class="ph filepath">WEB-INF/quartz-jobs.xml</span>) to realize that a node has dropped
                out. However, this does not have any further consequences.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forced switch of master node</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Usually all application nodes will negotiate among themselves who is going to become
                the master node. The outcome is random. </p>

            <p class="p">It is however possible to force one of the nodes to become the master node. This
                requires to tell the current master node to seize its master node related
                operations, like updating the full text search index, and giving way to the new
                master node. This process may take up to the timeout period (5 minutes by default),
                before the new node can take up its responsibility as the new master node.</p>
