    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The in-basket serves as a collection of anything that you may be concerned with.
        Typical sources for input are e-mails from colleagues or customers, phone calls, meetings,
        your own ideas, documents, and actions delegated by others to you.</p>

        <p class="p">You review your in-basket regularly, for example every morning.
                As long as you have not moved an item from the
            in-basket to either one of the non-actionable baskets, actionable basket, or planned
            items basket, the item stays in your in-basket. It should be your goal to regularly get
            your in-basket into an empty state.</p>

        <p class="p">Items show in your in-basket if you are newly responsible for an item according to the
            RACI scheme (see section 4.4 on page for more information). This is the case when an
            item was just created with you as a responsible, or when you have been made responsible
            for an item that somebody else was responsible for previously.</p>
