    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can organize users in groups. Groups help you managing large number of
        users.</p>

        <p class="p">Users can belong to many groups. In most
            respects, groups are treated just like users, e. g. they can be assigned roles, they can
            have an e-mail address, and they can be assigned to items.</p>

        <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/groupMembers.png" height="159" width="401"/></div><br/>
            
        </div>

        <p class="p">Users that belong to a group inherit the roles this group is assigned to. </p>

        <p class="p">Groups can be configured such that access permissions are automatically transferred
            between members of that group. The transfer only takes places for permissions associated
            with RACI roles. If for example a group member is „responsible“ for an item, all other
            members of the same group would have the permissions just as if they themselves were the
            „responsible“ for that item.</p>

        <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/grouptransfer.png" height="153" width="389"/></div><br/>
            
        </div>

        <p class="p">It is good practice defining groups and then assigning groups to roles, rather than
            single persons. This reduces the maintenance work when people come and go, since you
            have to make the modifications in one place only.</p>

        <p class="p">You can synchronize groups with an LDAP directory (see <a class="xref" href="../../07ForSystemAdmins/serverConfiguration/tabLDAP.html" title="If you want to use always the same password on your Track+ Service Desk account as on your other computers, you can connect Track+ Service Desk to a directory server (LDAP server, Active Directory). If you have several applications all running on the same server, you can provide a single login to that server and have Track+ Service Desk use the authentication of that login process.">LDAP and SSO configuration</a>).</p>
