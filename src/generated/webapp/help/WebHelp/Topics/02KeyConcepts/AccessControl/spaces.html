    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Spaces</h1>

    
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Via spaces you structure groups of items and control access to items. You can use one
        space per project or product, and you can organize spaces hierarchically. Spaces can
        furthermore be structured on the time axis via phases.</p>

        <p class="p">To support teamwork, you need to control access to items. Using access control
                has two advantages:</p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">You can only access items you have permission for. </li>

            <li class="li">You aren‘t bothered by information that doesn‘t concern you. 
                
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">In <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>, you use „<strong class="ph b">spaces</strong>“
                to control access to items (<a class="xref" href="#id12BOL7020G2__figspaces100">Figure 1</a>). Spaces themselves can contain spaces, you can organize them hierarchically.</p>

        <p class="p">An item always belongs to exactly one space.</p>

        <p class="p">What you can do with items in a space and its subspaces is defined by the „<strong class="ph b">roles</strong>“
                you have in a space. Roles in a subspace do not imply any
            roles in a superior space. Roles in a superior space are handed down to subordinated
            spaces unless there is a specific role assignment for the subordinated space. In this
            case the role inheritance mechanism is canceled and the new role applies to the
            subordinated space and all spaces below.</p>

        <p class="p">You can assume more than one role in the same space, and you can assume different roles
            in different spaces.</p>

        <div class="fig figborder" id="id12BOL7020G2__figspaces100"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/spaces1.png" height="274" width="334"/></div><br/><p class="figcapcenter">Spaces</p>
            
            
        </div>

        <p class="p">You can have your own private space that cannot be shared with others. All items in the
            private space are invisible to anybody else, regardless of their roles. Private spaces
            do not have subspaces. </p>

        <p class="p">Spaces where you do not have any access permissions for are invisible to you. Via access
            control permissions you define if you can create an item in a space, if you can be
            assigned an item, or whether you can see all items in a space or only your own.</p>

        <p class="p">If you manage projects, you can directly associate a project with a space. If you manage
            products, it is useful to relate a product or product family with a space, and product
            components with subspaces. Defining subspaces only makes sense if you have large teams
            and if you need to control access to different parts of your project or product.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, if you are developing technical products comprised of hardware components,
            software, and mechanical parts, you could create a top level project space for the
            system, and below separate spaces for hardware, software, and mechanics. In very large
            projects you could create more subspaces for components, or you could create spaces for
            components at the second level and beneath that split into hardware, software, and
            mechanics.</p>

        <div class="fig figborder" id="id12BOL7020G2__figspaces1200"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/projectshierarchy.png" height="157" width="402"/></div><br/><p class="figcapcenter">Spaces and sub-spaces</p>
            
            
        </div>

        <p class="p">In some environments it is required that members of a group inherit permissions of other
            members in the same group. For example, if you have a multi-company project, members of
            one company should be able to see items of other members of the same company, but not
            items of other companies. In that case access rights need to not just depend on a role
            but also on membership in a specific group. In <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span>, you can control whether a group enforces access right propagation or
                not.</p>
