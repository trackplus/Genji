        <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This tile gives you a concise
            state of your projects and releases. You can configure which
            projects and releases you want to consider. You can group the item
            numbers by various aspects, such as <span class="ph">priority</span>, item state, current
            responsible, etc. As with all other views, you can of course have
            more than one instance of it in your cockpit, for example one
            grouped by responsible, and one grouped by state.</p>

                <p class="p">Before you can use this tile you need to configure it. Follow
                    the general procedure to configure a tile outlined above to
                    get to the project summary configuration page, as described
                    above.</p>

                <p class="p">You can change the description
                    of the tile to give it a more precise meaning. This is
                    particular helpful if you use more than one instance of this
                    tile in your project, for example one grouped by state, and
                    one by responsible.</p>

                <p class="p">You can select which projects and/or releases you want to
