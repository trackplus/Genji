                <li class="li">All items - all items that you have permission to see, regardless of their
                    state. This can be a lot, and this filter will be mostly useful when you start
                    working with the system.</li>

                <li class="li">Outstanding - all items that you have permission to see, and that have not been

                <li class="li">Managers items - all unclosed items you are currently the manager of. You may
                    want to look after these items once in a while to monitor work progress.</li>

                    end date.</li>

                <li class="li">Closed recently- all items that you have permission to see, and that have been
