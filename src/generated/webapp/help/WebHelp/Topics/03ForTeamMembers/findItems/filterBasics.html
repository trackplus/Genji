     <h1 class="title topictitle1">Filter basics</h1>

     
     
     <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">There are two types of filters in <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> which can be combined. The first type is being
          assembled by selecting entries for properties and field values, the second type permits
          textual expression of filter conditions and includes full text search
          capability.</p>

          <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Logical Expressions</h2>
               
               <p class="p">View filters consist of two parts. The first part is assembled by selecting
                    entries from selection boxes for different item field. For example, by selecting
                    a project from the project selection list, and selecting „closed“ from the
                    state selection list, and deselecting everything else, the result set would
                    contain all closed items for this project. Selecting additional properties and
                    values would add these criteria to the filter.</p>

               <div class="fig figborder" id="id131M9K000CU__fig_1"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/filterLogicExample.png" height="77" width="217"/></div><br/>
                    
               </div>

               <p class="p">In logical terms, this part of the filter is comprised of the logical AND of the
                    logical ORs of the selections for each field. Referring to the figure above this
                    would be:</p>

               <pre class="pre codeblock">
(Status==opened OR Status==closed) AND 
     (Issue Type==Problem report OR Issue type==Requirement)
</pre>

               <p class="p">This principle covers most use cases. <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> provides the most important properties
                    for this form of filter criteria definition.</p>

               <p class="p">You can add additional properties including all your custom properties in the bottom area
                    of the filter definition mask. This permits you to define even complex logical
                    expressions.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Selecting all or nothing</h2>
               
               <p class="p">When you use the selection lists to specify a filter you select the desired
                    property values. Sometimes you want to select all possible values. In this case
                    it is advisable to not select any value. This makes the filter more efficient
                    and robust against future changes in the selection list.</p>

               <p class="p">Let us assume you wanted to create a filter that searches for open items in all
                    your projects. If you selected all projects, the filter would work fine. If you
                    later on work on a new project, that project will be missing in your filter and
                    you would have to add the new project to your filter.</p>

               <p class="p">If on the other hand you would keep the project selection list empty, even future
                    projects would be considered.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using parameters</h2><p class="p">Filters are usually completely determined with
                    all filter parameters. However, you can have the user enter parameters when
                    using a filter by setting the respective field selection to
                    $PARAMETER.</p>
<p class="p">When applying a filter, the user will then be prompted to
                    enter the selected parameters, like a specific release or state. </p>
This is
               helpful if you have a complex filter which should be flexible in just a small part.
               The filter could not be messed up, but it could still be configured by its user to a
               certain extend.</div>

          <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Including linked items</h2>
               
               <p class="p">You can include items linked to those that match the filter based on the custom
                    link types and a number predefined link types. The predefined link types are</p>

               <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">
                         <p class="p">all unclosed children of filtered items</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                         <p class="p">all children of filtered items</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                         <p class="p">MS Project predecessors</p>

                    </li>

               </ul>
