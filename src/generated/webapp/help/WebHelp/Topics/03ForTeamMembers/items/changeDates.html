    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">Items can have
        start and
        due dates. These dates are being used to notify users of items that are due soon, and to
        mark unresolved items as late. Start and due dates are also being used for Gantt diagrams.
        This section describes how to add or modify start and due dates.</p>

        <div class="section prereq p"><p class="p">You must have retrieved the item where you want to add or change start and due
                dates. This can be done by entering the item number in the search field, by
                selecting the item from the item overview or by using the „Edit“ entry of the
                context menu of the item overview.</p>
<p class="p">You must have been granted edit permissions
                for this item. You will not see an „Item Actions“ menu entry if you do not have
                proper permissions.</p>
<p class="p">You must have been granted permission to add and change
                start and due dates for this item. If this is not the case, you will see these
                fields deactivated.</p>
</div>

        <ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">From the item detail page, select action icon „Edit“.</span>
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">The screen switches into edit mode. By default, the start and due dates are on
                    the main tab. Your system administrator may have changed this.</span>
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Using the little calendar icon, add or change a start date or a due date or
                    both. You can also enter the date directly in the text field, but you have to
                    know the format.</span>
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">To make this change persistent, click on the „Save“ button in the tool bar.
                </span>
            </li>
</ol>

        <div class="section result"><p class="p">The item will now have the new start and/or due date. All watchers will be
                notified of the change, if they have configured their notification triggers and
                filters accordingly. </p>
<p class="p">Changes to start and due dates are recorded in the item
                history. Reminder e-mails will be sent for items due or overdue if the e-mail
                reminder facility is configured appropriately.</p>
