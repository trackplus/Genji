    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Planned values and actual cost</h1>

    
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Each item can have a budget or planned value of time and
        money. As work progresses, actual work performed or cost incurred is tracked against the
        budget. In this section we describe the main concepts related to planned value and actual
        cost tracking. Throughout this manual, we use the terms „planned value“ and „budget“
        synonymously, but prefer „planned value“ since this is the terminology used by the earned
        value method.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Work and Money</h2><p class="p">As work is performed processing this item each user
                that has worked on it can enter the time spent in a time sheet. Work and money are
                always booked against accounts. Which accounts are available for the project an item
                belongs to was defined by the system or project administrator.</p>

            <p class="p"> Budgeting work and cost tracking has to be enabled by the project administrator for
                the respective project, otherwise this tab will not be active. Furthermore, the user
                has to have granted proper permissions by the project administrator in order to be
                able to see the work/costs tab and enter values there.</p>
<p class="p">Adding work and
                monetary expenses by default changes the estimated remaining planned value (PV). If
                a change is not desired, it is possible to keep the old estimated value even when
                work and money are being booked on this item.</p>
<p class="p">It is possible to define the
                date for which the booking shall take place, in case work and expenses are booked at
                a later date than the date when the work was actually performed.</p>
<p class="p">For a regular
                user, adding work and money is irreversible. If an error was made, a negative amount
                can be booked to compensate for any wrong values.</p>
<p class="p">Work can be added in hours
                or workdays. Internally <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> keeps all values
                in hours. The internal value in hours is calculated from the users profile settings
                where for each user the hours per workday can be defined. If nothing is defined
                there, the project default setting is taken.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Planned Value</h2><p class="p">For each item, those permitted to do so can enter a
                planned value (PV). This planned value (or planned cost or budget) serves as a
                baseline. There is a difference between a monetary planned value and a planned value
                for work. You can use either, or both. The planned value can be changed, but the
                changes are recorded in the item history.</p>
<p class="p">Not everyone may be permitted to
                enter planned values; there is a special permission flag for this. It depends on
                your organization if you are permitted to enter and change budgets or if this is
                reserved to the managers. </p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Estimated Remaining Effort</h2><p class="p">Beside the planned value there is a
                value called the „estimated remaining effort“, i.e., estimated remaining work and
                estimated remaining cost. Here one can enter actual estimates how much work and
                money it will probably take to complete work on this item. As time goes by, the
                estimated remaining effort
                may become more and more precise. Together with the actual cost, it also may be
                larger or smaller than the planned value. Changes to the estimated remaining planned
                value are not recorded in the tracking database; the last value entered is the only
                visible one, including the person who entered it into the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> system.</p>
<p class="p">The estimated remaining
                planned value can be selected to compute the
                earned value or grade of completion. This can be
                more accurate than the oftentimes used 0/100 percent or 25/100 percent approach.
            </p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Actual Cost Overview</h2><p class="p">For each item you can get an overview
                of the
                actual cost already booked, and how they relate to
                the planned value and estimated remaining planned value. This overview can be
                filtered and shown in different views. There is a bar graph that concisely describes
                the situation for this item. The blue bars show the total budgets, while the other
                bars show the expenses that have already been booked, and the estimated remaining
                values. If the values booked itself or in conjunction with the estimated remaining
                planned values exceed the total planned value the bars are shown in red.</p>
<p class="p">It
                depends on your role with associated permission whether you can see all expenses, or
                only your own.</p>

If         accounting         is enabled for a project, it is possible to associate a planned value of work and cost (or a         work and cost budget) with an item. This permits to monitor items whether they are within         the budget or out of it. It also permits to monitor item progress by comparing actual work         and cost to the planned value. This section describes how to add a planned value to an item. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../../../Topics/03ForTeamMembers/items/changeBudget.html">Changing planned values</a></strong><br/>
You can assign a         planned         value or budget to each item in the <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Track+ Service Desk</span></span> system for         projects where accounting has been enabled.

This estimated remaining effort shall give an indication on work progress. It         can be changed any time, changes are not recorded in the history trail.</li>
