    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">The life-cycle of an item is characterized by its state.
        As work on an item progresses, it is typically moved from one state to another one.
        Oftentimes, a state change coincides with a change of the responsible person.</p>

        <div class="section prereq p">
            <p class="p">You must have retrieved the item which you want to move to another item type list.
                This can be done by entering the item number in the search field, or by selecting
                the item from the item overview. From this report you can also directly change item
                state using the context menu.</p>

            <div class="fig figborder"><br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" src="figures/contextStatus.png" height="145" width="148"/></div><br/>
                
            </div>

            <p class="p">You must have been granted edit permissions for this item.</p>

        </div>

        <ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">From the item detail page, click on tool bar icon „Change Status“.</span>
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">A new screen appears. Select the new state, and depending on your system
                    configuration a new responsible and other parameters.</span>
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Click on the „Save“ icon in the toolbar to finalize the operation. If you want
                    to close this item and it has children that are not closed you will be asked if
                    you want to automatically close them. If you deny the current item will remain
                    in its current state.</span>
            </li>
</ol>

        <div class="section result">
            <p class="p">The item will now have the new state. Be aware that this can change accessibility of
                the item, and the list of available states for another state change may have
                changed. This is defined by the workflow for this project and item type. </p>

            <p class="p">For example, it may not be possible to change an item from state „closed“ to
                „opened“, only „reopened“ may be possible.</p>

            <p class="p">People that are on the watch list of this item will be sent an e-mail of the state
                change if their automail is configured such.</p>
