                    to leave the estimated remaining effort as it is, or auto-adjust the value.
                    Auto-adjusting means that the new efforts are subtracted from the current value
                    of the estimated remaining effort. If desired, change the date for this expense,
                    in case you add all expenses at one time but you want to have them listed as

<p class="p">A new estimated
                remaining effort has now been assigned to this item in case you have chosen the
                auto-adjust option.</p>
<p class="p">For example, if an original planned value of 50 hours is
                entered, the initial estimated remaining effort will be set to 50 hours.</p>
<p class="p">If
                work of 10 hours is added, by default the estimated remaining effort will go down to
                40 hours.</p>
<p class="p">Let us assume you now manually change the estimated remaining effort
                to 45 hours, since you found out in the meantime that this task will take you longer
                than originally anticipated. If you now add another 6 hours of work, the estimated
                remaining effort will go down to 39 hours.</p>
<p class="p">If later on you should decide to
                make the budget change public, you can change the planned value to 45 hours. The
                estimated remaining effort will not be changed by this operation.</p>
