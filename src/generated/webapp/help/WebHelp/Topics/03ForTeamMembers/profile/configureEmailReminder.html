                profile to get reminders on Mondays only. If you set the lead to 10 days you will
                receive a reminder e-mail on Monday, April 16. So in the worst case you will receive
                a reminder just three days before the item is due.</p>
<p class="p">The example shown below
                demonstrates what happens if an item is due on Friday, and reminders were set for
                Mondays and Thursdays. With lead set to 3 days, the reminder will come on
                Thursday.</p>
